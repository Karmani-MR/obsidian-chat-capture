# Vault spec

The design this repo reproduces, taken from a real vault used every day for school, investing, career and AI work. `vault-template/` holds that vault's actual system files with personal content removed. Read this to understand why it's shaped this way, or to rebuild it by hand.

## Principles

1. **One center.** Everything links back to `00 Home/Home.md`, directly or through a hub. Nothing floats loose.
2. **Hubs, not deep folders.** Each area has one hub note: a map in `04 Maps`, a course's Materials note, Calendar MOC, Top of Mind. Notes link to their hub and hubs link to Home. The Graph Groups plugin turns that into a circular graph with Home in the middle and one colored starburst per hub and per course.
3. **Numbered folders by note type**, not by topic. Topics live in maps.
4. **AI is a guest with rules.** `AGENTS.md` sets the read order, a permissions table, how AI work is marked, batch-edit snapshots, note conventions, the skills and the calendar rules. Anything an agent writes is tagged `ai-assisted` until reviewed.
5. **Dates live in notes.** Classes, events and tasks are notes and task lines with properties. The calendars are views over them, never lists kept by hand.
6. **Nothing is lost.** Append, don't overwrite. Superseded files go in `Older versions`. Obsidian Git takes local snapshots every 30 minutes.

## A course

Adding a course creates five things, all in the same color:

- `04 Maps/CODE MOC.md`: the course hub, with instructor, meeting time, grading and `## Upcoming deadlines` (graded work as `[due::]` tasks).
- `12 School/<Term>/CODE - Name/` with `01 Syllabus & Schedule`, `02 Lecture Slides`, `03 Readings & Cases`, `04 Assignments`, `05 Models & Data`, `06 Exams & Review`, `07 My Work`, `08 Other`.
- `CODE Materials.md` in that folder. It links every file, which makes it the center of the course's starburst.
- `13 Calendar/Classes/CODE Class.md`: `kind: class`, `repeat: weekly`, `days`, `date` and `end-date`, `start-time`, `end-time`, `location`, and `skip` for single cancelled sessions.
- `13 Calendar/Prep/CODE Prep.md`: readings and prep under `## Before class`.

It also adds a row to School MOC, School Library, Calendar MOC and Color Key, a graph color group, and a CSS block. `scripts/new_course.py` does all of this.

**When a course ends:** move its folder into `12 School/Past Courses` from inside Obsidian (so links update), set the map to `status: past` with the tag `course/past`, and delete its CSS block. It turns gray.

## Calendar

- **Weekly Calendar** (`dv.view("13 Calendar/System/calendar-view")`): a time grid of classes, calls, meetings, exams and breaks, with due dates along the top. It has a `+ Add event` form, and you can double-click a slot to add one. Event kinds are class, exam, call, meeting, interview, appointment, club, work, personal, travel, break, academic and other. Breaks (`no-class: true`) hide classes automatically. An event with `replaces: "[[CODE Class]]"` moves or cancels one session.
- **To-Do Calendar** (`dv.view("13 Calendar/System/task-calendar")`): a month grid of every dated task, sorted into assignments, exams, prep and to-dos. It has filters, a day-by-day list, check-off in place and `+ Add to-do`. Optional fields: `[scheduled:: date]`, `[kind:: …]`, `[course:: CODE]`, `[time:: HH:MM]`.
- **add_event.py**: the command-line tool agents use to add, update, cancel or list events. It writes event notes and appends one line to the Calendar MOC event log. If the shell can't write, it falls back to the Local REST API.
- **Where dates go:** graded deadlines go in the course map, readings in the Prep note, timed commitments become event notes, and anything else goes in the chat note or `To-Do.md`.

## Agent layer

- `AGENTS.md` (root, the real operating manual), and `CLAUDE.md` (`@AGENTS.md`).
- Context: `00 Home/AI Context.md`, `Agent/USER.md`, `Top of Mind.md`, append-only `Agent/Agent Memory.md`, and `Goals`, `Principles` and `Writing Style`.
- Skills: the notes in `00 Home/Agent/Skills/` are the canonical instructions: Todays Focus, Weekly Review, Process Notes, Ingest, Vault Health, Write Like Me and Calendar Update. `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` are small pointers, so Claude Code gets `/todays-focus` and the rest. `vault-health/scripts/vault_health.py` does the checking. Each skill note ends with a `## Retro log`.
- Free-write zones are `01 Fleeting/AI Drafts`, `11 AI Chats`, `13 Calendar` (through the calendar skill), today's daily note and Top of Mind. Everywhere else, agents append or propose.

## Properties

Every note has `type`, `tags` and `created`. Hubs, projects, literature and permanent notes also have a one-sentence `summary`. The types are dashboard, profile, ai-context, guide, fleeting, literature, permanent, map, project, daily, weekly, ai-chat, materials, agent-policy, agent-skill, agent-memory, event, task-list and folder-guide.

## Plugins and settings

- **Community plugins:** Dataview (JS on), Templater (folder templates for 01–07), Calendar (Monday start, weekly notes in `07 Weekly`), Obsidian Git (30-minute local commits, push off) and **Graph Groups**, a custom plugin bundled in the template. Graph Groups colors file dots by folder, pins Home in the center and lays each hub and course out as its own starburst.
- **Optional:** Local REST API, for AI apps without file access.
- **Settings:** new notes go to `01 Fleeting`, attachments to `10 Attachments`, links update automatically, and `09 Templates` and Office `~$` lock files are excluded.
- **CSS snippet `color-coding`:** folder colors, a colored rail on each note, tag colors, and course title bars set by `cssclasses: [course-note, course-<code>]`.
