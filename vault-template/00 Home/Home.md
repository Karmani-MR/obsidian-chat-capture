# Home

**Today:** open the Calendar in the right sidebar and click today, or run *Daily notes: Open today's daily note* from the command palette (`Ctrl/Cmd + P`).

**This week:** [[Weekly Calendar]]: classes with rooms, calls, meetings, exams and due dates in one view. Mention a call or meeting in any AI chat and it lands there.

**This month:** [[To-Do Calendar]]: assignments, exams, readings and other to-dos day by day, with checkboxes. Mention a deadline or reading in any AI chat and it lands there.

**Capture:** create a new note (`Ctrl/Cmd + N`) — it lands in `01 Fleeting` and Templater asks for a title.

**Areas:** [[School MOC|School]] · [[School Library|Course files]] <!-- if:school -->
