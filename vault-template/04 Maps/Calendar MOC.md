**Open the calendar:** [[Weekly Calendar]]. Event notes live in `13 Calendar`; agents add to them with [[Skill - Calendar Update]].

**To-dos by month:** [[To-Do Calendar]] shows assignments, exams, pre-class prep (one Prep note per course, listed under Classes) and other dated to-dos ([[To-Do]]).

## Classes <!-- if:school -->
| | Class | Meets | Room | Prep | <!-- if:school -->
|---|---|---|---|---| <!-- if:school -->

## School dates <!-- if:school -->
Add breaks, the last day of classes and exam periods as events with `kind: break` and `no-class: true` (classes skip them automatically). <!-- if:school -->
